#  TrueToneFixer

Attempts to resolve issues with True Tone not being activated on one or more displays when waking from sleep with more than one display connected on macOS 11 and 12. Toggling True Tone off and on again after wake from sleep, while a bit of a hacky fix, appears to prevent the issue.

The implementation of True Tone control in [Shifty](https://github.com/thompsonate/Shifty) was used as a reference.
